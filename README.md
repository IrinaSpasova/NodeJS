> "NodeJS is an environment to run Javascript outside of the Browser". NodeJS was created in 2009 and it's built on top of Chrome's V8 Javascript
>  Engine. As you are probably aware of, every browser has an engine, a tool that compiles our code down to machine code and Chrome uses one by the
>  name of V8. Since the moment it was created, Node has evolved tremendously, and while there are many things to like about Node, some of the main 
>  ones are - large community, since that tremendously saves time on feature development, as well as the fact that with the help of Node, it's never
>  been easier to build Full-Stack Apps, since both Front-End And Back-End are built in one language, and you guessed that language is our beloved 
> Javascript."
